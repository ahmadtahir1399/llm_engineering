# ⚡ AI Interview Simulator

A multi-agent AI-powered interview simulator built with OpenAI and Gradio. Practice technical and behavioral interviews with real-time evaluation, adaptive difficulty, and personalized coaching — all in a sleek dark-mode UI.

---

## 🧠 Architecture — Three-Agent System

| Agent | Role |
|---|---|
| 🤖 **Interviewer** | Asks one question at a time and adapts difficulty based on your score |
| 📋 **Evaluator** | Scores every answer on clarity, technical depth, and overall quality (0–5) |
| 💡 **Coach** | Delivers what went well, what to improve, and a model answer after each response |

Each agent runs as an independent LLM call with its own system prompt, enabling genuine multi-agent coordination within a single conversation loop.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Adaptive difficulty** — scores ≥ 4 push harder questions; scores ≤ 1 simplify the next one
- **Structured evaluation** — JSON-based scoring rubric returned by the Evaluator agent
- **Live coaching** — the Coach agent generates a model answer after every question
- **Role presets** — Backend, Frontend, Full-Stack, AI/ML, Data Science, DevOps, System Design, PM, or any custom role
- **Configurable session** — choose 3–10 questions per session
- **Final Score Card** — session summary with averaged scores and a performance verdict
- **Clean terminal-style UI** — dark theme with monospace chat, built with Gradio Blocks

### 1. Clone or download the project

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd ai-interview-simulator
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # macOS / Linux
venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows
```

## 🧪 Example Session

```
Role: AI / ML Engineer    Difficulty: Senior    Questions: 5

Q1: Explain the difference between bagging and boosting.
    → Clarity: 4/5  Technical: 3/5  Overall: 3/5
    → Coach: "You covered the core idea well. Missing: variance vs bias trade-off..."
    → Model Answer: [provided]

Q2 (same difficulty): What is gradient vanishing and how do you address it?
    ...

Q5 (adjusted harder): Design a real-time feature store for a recommendation system.
    ...

📊 Score Card
  Clarity:   3.8 / 5  ████░
  Technical: 3.4 / 5  ███░░
  Overall:   3.6 / 5  ████░
  → "Solid performance. A bit more practice and you'll shine."
```
